The fine-tuned transformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78 on the validation set. Next, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06270"},{"name":"Understanding Divergent Framing of the Supreme Court Controversies: Social Media vs. News Outlets","authors":["Jinsheng Pan","<b>Zichen Wang</b>","Weihong Qi","Hanjia Lyu","Jiebo Luo"],"publication":" IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData), 2023","description":"Understanding the framing of political issues is of paramount importance as it significantly shapes how individuals perceive, interpret, and engage with these matters. While prior research has independently explored framing within news media and by social media users, there remains a notable gap in our comprehension of the disparities in framing political issues between these two distinct groups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive investigation, focusing on the nuanced distinctions both qualitatively and quantitatively in the framing of social media and traditional media outlets concerning a series of American Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action, student loans, and abortion rights.","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10386532"},{"name":"Bias or Diversity?
