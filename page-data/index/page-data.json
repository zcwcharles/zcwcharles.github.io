The fine-tuned transformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78 on the validation set. Next, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06270"},{"name":"Bias or Diversity?

Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was applied, quantifying the semantic discrepancy in domestic politics, economic issues, social issues, and foreign affairs. Additionally, we compare the most frequent n-grams in media headlines to provide further qualitative insights.","link":"https://workshop-proceedings.icwsm.org/abstract.php?id=2023_25"}],"experience":[{"name":"MarsWalk","description":"Backend & Machine Learning Engineer (Internship), May 2023 - Present","link":""},{"name":"StoreHub","description":"Front-End Developer, August 2020 - May 2022","link":"https://www.storehub.com/"},{"name":"Trip.com Group","description":"Software Engineer, September 2019 - August 2020","link":"https://group.trip.com/"},{"name":"SonicWall Inc.","description":"Associate Software Engineer, July 2018 - August 2019","link":"https://www.sonicwall.com/"}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming Languages","description":"Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, C++, Java"},{"name":"Frameworks & Databases","description":"Flask, LangChain, React.js, Redux, PyTorch, Gradio, Pandas, Redis, MySQL"},{"name":"Tools & Others","description":"Docker, Azure, Git, Jenkins, Jira, Agile, Scrum, RESTful API design"}]}},"resume":{"publicURL":"/static/5361224468cfca1c87dade4dcdcf43b6/Resume.pdf"},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
