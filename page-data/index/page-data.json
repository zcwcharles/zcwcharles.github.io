The fine-tuned transformer-based language model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.84 and an F1 score of 0.78 on the validation set. Next, we conduct a computational analysis to quantify the extent and dynamics of partisanship in news titles. While some aspects are as expected, our study reveals new or nuanced differences between the three media groups.","link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06270"},{"name":"Understanding Divergent Framing of the Supreme Court Controversies: Social Media vs. News Outlets","authors":["Jinsheng Pan","<b>Zichen Wang</b>","Weihong Qi","Hanjia Lyu","Jiebo Luo"],"publication":" IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData), 2023","description":"Understanding the framing of political issues is of paramount importance as it significantly shapes how individuals perceive, interpret, and engage with these matters. While prior research has independently explored framing within news media and by social media users, there remains a notable gap in our comprehension of the disparities in framing political issues between these two distinct groups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive investigation, focusing on the nuanced distinctions both qualitatively and quantitatively in the framing of social media and traditional media outlets concerning a series of American Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action, student loans, and abortion rights.","link":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10386532"},{"name":"Bias or Diversity?

Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was applied, quantifying the semantic discrepancy in domestic politics, economic issues, social issues, and foreign affairs. Additionally, we compare the most frequent n-grams in media headlines to provide further qualitative insights.","link":"https://workshop-proceedings.icwsm.org/abstract.php?id=2023_25"}],"experience":[{"name":"ByteDance Ltd.","description":"Software Engineer, Jan 2024 - Present","link":"https://www.bytedance.com/en/"},{"name":"StoreHub","description":"Front-End Developer, August 2020 - May 2022","link":"https://www.storehub.com/"},{"name":"Trip.com Group","description":"Software Engineer, September 2019 - August 2020","link":"https://group.trip.com/"},{"name":"SonicWall Inc.","description":"Associate Software Engineer, July 2018 - August 2019","link":"https://www.sonicwall.com/"}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming Languages","description":"Golang, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Java, C++"},{"name":"Frameworks & Libraries","description":"Kitex, Hertz, Eventbus, Flask, LangChain, React.js, Redux, PyTorch, Pandas"},{"name":"Data Processing","description":"Redis, MySQL, Thrift, protobuf, Elastic Search"},{"name":"Tools","description":"Git, Docker, Azure, AWS, Jenkins"},{"name":"Others","description":"Distributed system, Asynchronous processing, Data Mining, Agile development"}]}},"resume":{"publicURL":"/static/a21b0ed10815e6548a548eb65890a8fb/Zichen Wang_Resume.pdf"},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
